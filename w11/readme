Short Report: Brain MRI Image Segmentation Using Thresholding and Morphological Operations

The objective of the work is to segment a brain using intensity-based thresholding methods and morphological image processing techniques.

A single 2D slice was extracted from the skimage.data.brain() MRI dataset. The image intensities were normalized to an 8-bit range (0-255) using min-max normalization to ensure compatibility with histogram-based thresholding algorithms.
